`Railway Homework (n@raiden)`

# Demonstrated Work

## 1. Deploy Project from Local Upload

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4943550-9f88-4456-9557-b01f2aabeedf
 
### Description

- zero friction local-to-cloud deployment feature, few seconds + requires zero local setup

---

## 2. Repository Adaptation/Migration Pipeline (Prototype)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61136324-8c68-4dbc-821c-d4de7ff41ecc

### Description

- generative pipeline prototype for migrating repos into Railway infrastructure
- can also help make templates faster
- 2-step pipeline:
    - architecturing:
        - identifies services needed from repo analysis
        - creates/adapts Railway + docker configs and inter-service env refs
    - fixing:
        - analyzes deploy/build logs after deploy
        - tries (for N attempts) to analyze + edit project and redeploy

### Gains

- accelerate migrations
- accelerate template creation from repos  
- minimize docs reading required by new users, by using docs implicitly into elaborate pipelines
- also provide new implicit, docs-grounded features (eg. `analyze logs button in deploy logs in case service crashed`)

---

## 3. Railway TypeScript SDK

### Description

- typescript sdk for Railway IaC in `sdk/railway-typescript-sdk`.

- handles auth, setup, adds features on top of gql schemas

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
import { RailwaySdkClient } from "@railway/sdk";

const railway = new RailwaySdkClient({});

const localDirService = await railway.services.create({
  projectId: "aa00bee7-0aa5-4f0f-bbd4-1e7685f4ca37",
  dir: "./examples/music-project/api-py",
  name: "serviceFromLocalPythonApi",
  variables: { SOME_KEY: "test_value_123" },
});

const projectData = await railway.graphql.query({
  project: {
    data: {
      id: true,
      name: true,
      services: {
        edges: {
          node: {
            id: true,
            name: true,
          },
        },
      },
    },
    variables: {
      id: "aa00bee7-0aa5-4f0f-bbd4-1e7685f4ca37",
    },
  },
});
````

### Benefits

- type definitions from gql schema help write queries faster and more precisely
- service methods streamline deploy/remove ops from all sources (including local)
- faster team iterations and prototyping
- public sdk release to emphasize railway's IaC capabilities

# Additional Product Suggestions

## SDKs

- expand available SDKs, libraries to allow new batch of startups to build on top of Railway, esp. cases of deploying on behalf of users

## Internal AI-based tooling

- internal tooling grounded in Railway's GQL schema and UI design system (+ work on one ?) to iterate on features faster
- gen ai-driven project migrations, templateing, cloud logs, debugging tools
- internal ai tooling to scaffold hundreds/thousands of use cases examples and guides to widen reach of Railway

## Documentation & Guide

- work on a high ROI guide-based and visual-heavy portal (eg. `learn.railway.com`), expand user adoption

## Competitors

- lead operations to capture segments to establish Railway as an `entrypoint reference` - equivalent of what used to be `create-react-app`, or `firebase` for the easiest plug-and-play db ... but for infrastructure. and communicate this very effectively at scale, to capture a new generation of devs
